# Concept: Edge Detection and Contours
# Edges are boundaries where pixel intensity changes sharply.
# Contours are the outlines of objects: connect-the-dots along edges.
# This file finds shapes in an image and draws bounding boxes around them.

img = cv2.imread(contour_input_img)   # Use an image with clear, distinct shapes
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# --- EDGE DETECTION ---
# Sobel: detects edges in one direction (horizontal, dx=1, dy=0)
sobelx = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=5)

# Canny: applies smoothing, gradient detection, and hysteresis
# (50, 150) are the low and high thresholds for what counts as an edge
canny = cv2.Canny(gray, 50, 150)

# --- CONTOURS ---
# findContours scans the binary image and traces outlines of white regions
# RETR_TREE: finds all contours and organizes parent-child relationships
# CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE: compresses straight lines to just their endpoints
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(canny, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
